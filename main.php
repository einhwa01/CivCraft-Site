    <blockquote>Welcome to the Civival pre-alpha.  The game is still under heavy development and in all likelihood nothing works.</blockquote>
    <p>Thank's for checking out Civival.  The game will change a lot as the main direction is still not really determined.  Expect the game/site to be way different in a few months time
    	then what it is today.  To get started, click on 'Your Civilization' to create your civ.  From there you can start making build and explore orders as well as recruiting for you army. 
    	Be sure to maintain a balance among all things including research or you civilization will fail.  People will die or desert and you will be left with nothing.  Once you have a thriving
    	society it's time to look outwards for other players.  Will you pray on the weak?  Or band together and protect the world.</p>
